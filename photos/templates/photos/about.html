    A user/patient who thinks he or she has chickenpox would be able to upload an image
    of the affected area and submit it to our application in order to receive a probability estimation
    of how likely it is that he or she has chickenpox, and thus whether or not he or she should go to
    a healthcare facility, or can simply treat the ailment with home remedies.

    The frontend of SymCheck is implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Users should thus be able
    to view and interact with SymCheck within all supported browsers. The backend of the SymCheck is
    implemented using Python, with Django as its web framework. And the machine learning algorithm developed
    for image-based classification has been implemented using the Keras library with TensorFlow as its backend engine.
    Dialogflow and Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s Cloud9 were added to the SymCheck list of technologies for
    the implementation of an AI-based Chatbot to field user questions, and a code collaboration tool to
    allow for more seamless development by our team, respectively. AWS's Elastic Beanstalk and Certificate
    Manager (ACM), as well as Amazon Route 53 were added to our list of prevailing technologies for the
    purposes of deploying and scaling our application, allowing for secure browsing, and for
    establishing a unique, and more professional domain name for our live
    application, respectively.
